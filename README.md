# ØVEL : A Planetary Systems Engine

OVEL is an interactive planetary simulation engine built in p5.js.
It models archetypal forces (Jupiter, Saturn, etc.) not as symbols, but as **governing behaviors** acting on a shared field.

This is not a game.
This is not a productivity tool.
This is not a prediction engine.

OVEL exists to **make systemic balance visible**.

---

## Core Premise

Planets do not control objects.
They regulate **relationships**.

Each planetary class defines:

* How growth occurs
* How limits are enforced
* How errors are handled
* How time is experienced

Meaning emerges from interaction, not instruction.

## Ethos (Read Before Using)

### 1. No Optimization

OVEL is not designed to be “won,” optimized, or solved.

If a configuration feels powerful, it will eventually destabilize.
If it feels stable, it will eventually stagnate.

Balance is **temporary by design**.

---

### 2. No Moral Scoring

The system does not judge.
It does not reward virtue or punish failure.

It demonstrates **tradeoffs**, not outcomes.

---

### 3. No Deletion Without Consequence

Nothing is removed without cost.
Collapse leaves traces.
Failure persists.

Mercy redistributes — it does not erase.

---

### 4. The User Is Not a God

Interaction is constrained.
Invocations carry cost.
Some states resist interference.

If the system refuses you, it is functioning correctly.

---

### 5. Time Is Not Neutral

Time is cyclical, uneven, and irreversible.

Waiting is an action.
Silence is meaningful.
Decay is not a bug.

---

## What This Is For

* Reflection on systems and governance
* Exploration of growth vs constraint
* Ritualized systems thinking
* Generative art that refuses completion

---

## What This Is Not For

* Productivity optimization
* Behavioral prediction
* Gamification
* Financial extraction
* Fast content

---

## Design Principle

> **Expand only what can remain whole.**

If a feature violates this principle, it does not belong here.

---

## Status

OVEL is a living system.
It is allowed to be unfinished.
It is allowed to be difficult.
It is allowed to resist you.

---

## License (Philosophical)

You may fork, study, and extend this system.

You may not:

* Strip it of context
* Reduce it to metrics
* Use it to manipulate or coerce

Respect the field.

*This project is an experiment in cosmology as code.*

# OVEL

**OVEL is the invariant that determines whether a structure can continue.**

It does not define meaning, purpose, or value.
It defines persistence.

Structures that remain coherent under constraint may proceed.
Structures that require contradiction to advance eventually terminate.

Nothing is judged.
Nothing is preserved by intent.

Only coherence survives contact with reality.

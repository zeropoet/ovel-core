# OVEL — ABSOLUTE SPECIFICATION

OVEL is a constraint system.

It is not:

* a theme
* a narrative
* a visual identity
* a sound aesthetic
* a metaphor
* a community experiment

Any attempt to treat it as such is incorrect.

---

## 1. Law (Non-Negotiable)

**Invariant:**

```
136
```

This value is final.

* It is not symbolic
* It is not approximate
* It is not contextual

Any system, output, artifact, sound, image, animation, or code path that does not resolve to **exactly 136** under validation **is not OVEL**.

No exceptions.
No “close enough.”
No aesthetic override.

---

## 2. Structure (No Interpretation Layer)

OVEL is implemented as a **3D relational constraint engine**.

* Nodes contribute numeric value
* Traversals compute sums
* Multiple independent traversals must agree
* Agreement is identity

If a result depends on *how* you traverse the system to remain meaningful, it is invalid.

---

## 3. Planets Are Functions, Not Symbols

Planetary names exist solely as **behavioral labels**.

They do not imply mythology.
They do not imply belief.
They do not imply spirituality.

They map to *specific, enforced behaviors*:

* **Saturn**
  Redistributes pressure without altering sum
  Introduces resistance, delay, and refusal
  If Saturn fails, execution stops

* **Jupiter**
  Expands influence without adding value
  Cannot operate without Saturn
  If expansion alters the invariant, the system is lying

* **Sun**
  Verifies equivalence across all valid paths
  If paths disagree, identity collapses
  Sun failure invalidates the work entirely

All planetary behavior is testable.
None of it is optional.

---

## 4. Canonical vs Non-Canonical (Hard Line)

A work is **canonical** if and only if:

1. All required traversals resolve to 136
2. Saturn redistribution preserves 136
3. Jupiter expansion preserves 136
4. The Sun confirms equivalence

If any condition fails:

* the work may exist
* it may be displayed
* it may be interesting

But it is **explicitly not OVEL**.

This distinction is enforced in code and documentation.
There is no soft acceptance.

---

## 5. Sound Is Verification

Sound is not expressive in OVEL.
Sound is **audit output**.

* Traversals → harmonic structures
* Saturn → temporal resistance
* Jupiter → spectral expansion
* Sun → tonic collapse

If it sounds coherent but fails validation, it is rejected.
If it validates but sounds unpleasant, it is accepted.

Taste is irrelevant.
Truth is not.

---

## 6. Glyphs Are Residue, Not Design

OVEL glyphs are never authored.

They emerge from:

* traversal intersections
* constraint density
* expansion overlap
* final collapse

If a glyph is designed first and justified later, it is invalid.

---

## 7. Transparency Clause

Nothing in OVEL is hidden.

* All constraints are explicit
* All validation rules are visible
* All failures are detectable
* All canonical decisions are reproducible

If something cannot be explained mechanically, it does not belong in the system.

---

## 8. Refusal Is a Feature

OVEL is allowed to say **no**.

* No to collaborators
* No to outputs
* No to expansions
* No to interpretations

A system that cannot refuse is decorative.
OVEL is not decorative.

---

## 9. Final Definition (Exact)

OVEL is a system in which:

> Multiple independent paths
> must resolve to the same invariant
> under constraint, expansion, and verification
> without exception.

If it survives that process, it is OVEL.
If it does not, it is not.

No ambiguity remains.
